# CSI385_semester_fat12_idgaf

Please develop in Linux on Eclipse for now, if you can. 

TO call the program, navigate to within the DEBUG folder and call the program via 
./csi_385_project 2

The param after the program caller defines which floppy you will be using. If one is not defined, or illegally defined, it will just use floppy 1.
